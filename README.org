* Introduction

These instructions are for setting up a privileged LXC container with
a Haskell development environment. The container runs Debian GNU/Linux
10 (code-named Buster). One can connect to the container via SSH and
VNC. When connected via VNC, the clipboard is shared between the
container and the host machine thanks to the =autocutsel= tool.

* Prerequisites

[[http://linuxcontainers.org/][LXC]] (Linux Containers) is a virtualization method specific to
operating systems based on the Linux kernel. Therefore, you need to
have a Linux-based operating system to follow these
instructions. Furthermore, the instructions are written for the
GNU/Linux Debian Buster operating system, though they should be
applicable to other GNU/Linux distributions (possibly with minor
modifications).


* Instructions

These are instructions for LXC 3.0.3 in Debian GNU/Linux Buster. If you do not
use Logical Volume Management (LVM), skip steps that are tagged with "(LVM)".

  1. Choose a name for the LXC container. In this running example =buster-2=
     will be used:
     : export CNAME=buster-2
  2. (LVM) Choose an LVM volume group (set to the group you have on your host
     machine):
     : export VGNAME=howard-vg
  3. (LVM) Choose an LVM volume:
     : export LVNAME=$CNAME
  4. (LVM) Choose the size of the container's root file system:
     : export FSSIZE=50G
  5. (LVM) To create a privileged container named "buster-2" with several
     things installed, where the root file system is stored in an LVM volume:
     : sudo lxc-create --name $CNAME --bdev lvm --lvname $LVNAME --vgname $VGNAME --fssize $FSSIZE --template debian -- --release buster --package sudo,emacs,xfonts-base,tightvncserver,xfce4,xfce4-goodies,haskell-platform,haskell-stack,elpa-haskell-mode,elpa-smex,firefox-esr,xserver-xorg-core,curl,autocutsel,git,unar,rsync,bzip2
  6. To create a privileged container named "buster-2" with several
     things installed, where the root file system is stored in an LVM volume:
     : sudo lxc-create --name $CNAME --template debian -- --release buster --package sudo,emacs,xfonts-base,tightvncserver,xfce4,xfce4-goodies,haskell-platform,haskell-stack,elpa-haskell-mode,elpa-smex,firefox-esr,xserver-xorg-core,curl,autocutsel,git,unar,rsync,bzip2
  7. Start the container:
     : sudo lxc-start --name $CNAME
  8. Set a password for the root user:
     : sudo lxc-attach --name $CNAME passwd
  9. Add a user =dev= to the container:
     : sudo lxc-attach --name $CNAME -- useradd -m -s /bin/bash dev
  10. Set the password for the =dev= user:
      : sudo lxc-attach --name $CNAME -- passwd dev
  11. Add =dev= to the =sudo= group for the root privileges:
      : sudo lxc-attach --name $CNAME -- usermod -a -G sudo dev
  12. (Something here is missing about =TTY=; it is resolved by adding
      the =dev= user via =visudo=).
  13. Copy the public SSH key of your user on the host machine to the
      =dev= user in the container:
      : ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub dev@192.168.122.195
  14. Install the Keybase program (the 64-bit version):
      : sudo lxc-attach --name $CNAME -- curl --output /tmp/keybase.deb --remote-name https://prerelease.keybase.io/keybase_amd64.deb
      : sudo lxc-attach --name $CNAME -- sudo apt install -y /tmp/keybase.deb
      : sudo lxc-attach --name $CNAME -- su - dev -c run_keybase
  15. Start the VNC server as the =dev= user:
      : sudo lxc-attach --name $CNAME -- su - dev -c vncserver
      This will ask for a password so create one.
  16. Kill the VNC server:
      : sudo lxc-attach --name $CNAME -- su - dev -c "vncserver -kill :1"
  17. Put the following in =~/.vnc/xstartup= in the container:
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
	#!/bin/bash
	xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
	autocutsel -fork
	startxfce4 &
      #+END_SRC
  18. Start the VNC server again and set the screen resolution:
      : sudo lxc-attach --name $CNAME -- su - dev -c "vncserver -geometry 2320x1305"
  19. Install a VNC viewer on the host machine. I recommend Remmina, though
      others will work. GNOME's Remote Desktop Viewer captures certain
      keystrokes such as Ctrl+W, which means they cannot be used in the VNC
      session; this is why I decided to go with another VNC viewer, namely
      Remmina.
      : sudo apt-get install remmina remmina-plugin-vnc
  20. Start a VNC viewer on the host machine. Provide the container's IP
      address and a port (the port is typically 5901).

** Installing Nix (an unfinished section)
One might want to install the Nix package manager as a number of Haskell
projects use it as a build system. Unfortunately, there is no official Debian
binary package for Nix. Therefore, we will build the package ourselves from an
unofficial [[https://github.com/KaiHa/nix-debian][Debian source package]]. To install the Nix package manager in the
LXC container:

  1. Install =git-buildpackage= on the host:
     : sudo apt-get install git-buildpackage
  2. Create a Debian GNU/Linux Buster image that will be used for building the
     package for Nix:
     : DIST=buster git-pbuilder create
  3. Get the unofficial Debian source package:
     : git clone https://github.com/KaiHa/nix-debian.git
     : cd nix-debian
  4. Build a Debian binary package for Nix:
     : gbp buildpackage --git-pbuilder --git-dist=buster
  5. Find two Debian packages in =../nix.deb-export/=. My host machine is the
     =amd64= architecture, so for Nix 2.2.1 the packages are
     =nix_2.2.1-1_amd64.deb= and =nix-dbgsym_2.2.1-1_amd64.deb=.
  6. Copy the =nix_2.2.1-1_amd64.deb= package to the LXC container:
     : rsync -a --progress *deb dev@192.168.122.142:/tmp/
  7. In the LXC container install dependencies for the binary package for Nix:
     : sudo lxc-attach --name $CNAME -- su - dev -c "sudo apt-get install -y libdbd-sqlite3-perl libwww-curl-perl libboost-context1.67.0 libbrotli1 libreadline7 libsodium23 perl-dbdabi-94 readline-common"
  8. Finally install the =nix_2.2.1-1_amd64.deb= package:
     : sudo lxc-attach --name $CNAME -- su - dev -c "sudo dpkg -i /tmp/nix_2.2.1-1_amd64.deb"
  9. Add the following to =/etc/nix/nix.conf= in the container (create the
     file if it does not exist):
     : build-use-sandbox = false
  10. To have =nixpkgs= working properly, run the following in the container:
      : nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable
      : nix-channel --update
  11. Stop the container. On the host machine add the following line to
      =/etc/sysctl.d/80-lxc-userns.conf= (create the file if it does not
      exist):
      : kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1
  12. Restart =sysctl= on the host:
      : sudo sysctl --system
  13. Start the LXC container:
      : sudo lxc-start --name $CNAME
* To be done
** TODO Start the VNC server on system boot
   - This is not happening right now so enable it such that one doesn't have
     to SSH before VNCing.
** TODO Create LXC containers with a disk stored in LVM
   - The default is a 20 GB root partition =/=, which can be too little,
     especially when Nix is used. When creating a container with =lxc-create=,
     there is an option =--bdev= that can take "lvm" as a value and further
     arguments can be provided, as explained in the man pages of =lxc-create=.
     - [2019-08-28 wed]: I am not completely sure, but it might be the case
       that I have to create LVM logical volumes via a live boot from
       USB. When booted regularly from the disk, I attempted to run =sudo
       lvcreate -L 50G -n buster-2 howard-vg=, but I get this:
       : Insufficient free space: 12800 extents needed, but only 0 available
       yet there is 173 GB of free space in the volume group according to the
       output of =sudo vgdisplay=.
** TODO Share the camera, microphone and speaker devices with the container
** TODO Set up xmonad
** TODO Decrease the display lag
   - Maybe there is something to configure in =/etc/X11= as generated
     by the =gtf= tool from the =xserver-xorg-core= package with
     ModeLine and a dummy driver.
